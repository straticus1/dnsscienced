 focuses on data integrity and privacy through features like mandatory DNSSEC validation, support for DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), and Query Name Minimisation. It enhances security by hardening against cache poisoning, performing strict response scrubbing, and employing high-entropy random port/query ID generation. 
Key security features include:
DNSSEC Validation: Automatically validates DNS signatures to ensure responses are authentic and not tampered with, rejecting forged, malicious, or incorrect data.
Privacy & Encryption: Supports DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) for encrypted communication between the client and resolver.
Query Name Minimisation: Reduces privacy leakage by not sending the full query name to authoritative name servers.
Hardening Measures:
Response Scrubbing: Cleans incoming responses of unnecessary or malicious data.
Harden-Glue: Protects against malicious "glue" records (out-of-zone data).
Case Preservation (0x20 bit encoding): Increases resistance to hijacking by capitalizing random letters in queries.
Max Randomness: Uses strong random number generators for Query IDs and source ports to prevent spoofing.
Access Control: Allows administrators to restrict which clients can send queries.
Rate Limiting: Protects against DoS/DDoS attacks by limiting queries per second.
Local Filtering/Blocking: Supports Response Policy Zones (RPZ) to block malicious domains.
Authority Zones: Allows local loading of root zones for increased independence and security. 
Unbound's design minimizes the attack surface by excluding non-essential features like Dynamic DNS updates.
